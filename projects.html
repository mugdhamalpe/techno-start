            <h3 class="title">01. Face detection</h3>
            <p class="text">One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on computer science projects for students is face detection software. This project focuses on building a face detection software using the OpenCV library. The face detection program will be modelled in a way that it can detect faces in live stream videos from webcam or video files stored in a PC’s local storage. The software uses pre-trained XML classifiers to detect faces in real-time and track them. You can also use different classifiers to identify various objects through this detection program.
                <br><br>To run this program, you need to install the OpenCV library on your local machine. Also, it would be best if you created appropriate paths for the XML classifier files before executing the program. </p>

            <h3 class="title">02. Online auction system</h3>
            <p class="text">In an online auction, buyers and sellers engage in transactional business, wherein buyers purchase items through price bidding. Here, the bids have a starting price and an ending time. Potential buyers who place the highest bidding price for an item are declared the winners and owners of particular items. 
                <br><br>
                In this project, you will create a secure online auction system using the fraud detection method with binary classification. If a user wants to buy a product through an online auction, they must provide their identification details like PAN number, email address, license number, etc. The system will then screen the users, authenticate, and authorize them. Only authorized users can bid in the auction. The system will be designed to predict fraudulent users in the early stages, thereby eliminating the risk of online fraud and scams. This beginner-level computer science projects will help build a strong foundation for fundamental programming concepts.</p>

            <p class="text">This project involves the creation of an evaluation system that can analyze the academic performance of students by utilizing the fuzzy logic method. In the fuzzy logic method, you will consider three parameters, namely, attendance, internal marks, and external marks, to evaluate the final academic performance of students of an institution. The fuzzy inference system is much more accurate than conventional techniques.
                <br><br>
                While developing this Computer Science project, make sure that the student information uploaded is correct (devoid of errors). Faulty data entry may lead to inaccurate results. </p>

            <h3 class="title">04. e-Authentication system</h3>
            <p class="text">This project focuses on building an e-Authentication system using a combination of QR code and OTP for enhanced security. The e-Authentication system is designed to avoid hacking of accounts through shoulder surfing and misuse of login credentials. To be able to use the system, a user has to first register in the system by entering the basic registration details (name, address, zip code, etc.).
                <br><br>
                Once the registration is complete, the user can access the login module to authenticate the account by entering the email id and password combination they used during registration. Then, the user can proceed to the next authentication step using either of the two options – QR (Quick Response) code or OTP (One Time Password). As per the option selected by the user, the system will generate a QR Code or an OTP. While the QR code will be sent to the user’s mail id, the OTP will be sent via SMS to the registered mobile number of the user. 
                <br><br>
                The system randomly generates the QR Code and OTP at the time of login. It makes the login more secure. However, to use this system, one always needs an active Internet connection.</p>

            <p class="text">This is a project where you will design a cursor that can move through desktop and perform actions based on hand gestures. The system’s object movement will be based on RGB (red, green, and blue) colour – it can detect RGB colour object that will function as the mouse. It would help if you imported the Java AWT library to coordinate with the cursor. The system setting uses a webcam to track the movement of the red, green, and blue objects and based on the object movement patterns, accordingly trigger an event. 
                <br><br>
                The cursor movement system will acquire a single frame from the video recorded by the webcam and flip the frame for the user to see. It converts the captured image into a binary image wherein the RGB objects will become white. The system further adds a bounding box around the object that the user can move throughout the display.  </p>

            <p class="text">This is one of the interesting computer science project ideas to create. As the name suggests, this Computer Science project involves building a prediction system that can analyze and predict the crime rate of a particular location. Naturally, the system needs to be fed with relevant data. It uses the K-means data mining algorithm to predict the crime rate. The K-means algorithm can cluster co-offenders and organized crime groups by detecting relevant crime patterns via hidden links, link prediction, and statistical analysis of crime data. 
                <br><br>
                It functions somewhat like this – the admin will feed the crime data into the system. The algorithm will analyze crime data stored in a database and extract information and patterns from it. It will then collate the crime groups based on the patterns found in the dataset. The clusters will be made based on factors like where the crime took place, which people were involved in the crime, and when the crime occurred.</p>

            <h3 class="title">07. Android battery saver system</h3>
            <p class="text">This is one of the simple computer science projects yet an exciting one. The Android battery saver is designed to analyze the battery usage data from built-in classes and create a consolidated list of apps that drain the power of the Android phone. The system can also determine the battery level of the phone. In situations where the battery level is low, and numerous apps are consuming too much power, this system will trigger an alarm telling the user to force stop or close the apps that are drawing power.
                <br><br>
                While the battery saver system has no backend, it uses Android Studio as the frontend. Since the system feeds on data from the Android phone, it does not need a backend framework. The primary aim of this battery saver system is to notify users of the apps that are high on power consumption, thereby allowing them to take specific actions to stop battery drainage. </p>

            <h3 class="title">08. Symbol recognition</h3>
            <p class="text">This is one of the excellent computer science project ideas for beginners. The proposed project seeks to build a system that can recognize symbols inserted by the user. This symbol recognition system leverages an image recognition algorithm to process images and to identify symbols. First, the system converts RGB objects into grayscale images which is then further converted into black and white images. During the process, image processing is applied to remove unwanted objects and environmental interference. The system further uses optical character recognition for recognizing the images with 60-80% accuracy. This is one of the interesting computer science projects. 
                <br><br>
                In the system, all symbol templates will be stored in a specific directory. The size of each image is fixed to allow the easy recognition of the symbols with accuracy. The templates will remain in black and white form, and the system will create a dataset of these templates. When a user inputs a query image into the system, it will resize the query image, compare the resized image values against the template image values in the dataset, and finally display the result in text format. So, while the system takes inputs as images, it delivers output in a textual form.</p>
